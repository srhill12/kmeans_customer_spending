# Customer Segmentation Analysis
This project demonstrates the use of K-means clustering to segment customers based on their shopping behavior. The analysis uses a scaled dataset of customer shopping data and explores clusters with different numbers of segments.

# Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries:

pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib

# Usage
Follow the steps outlined below to replicate the analysis. Make sure to have the dataset customer-shopping-scaled.csv in the Resources directory.

## Steps
# Step 1: Data Import and Review
Import the required libraries and read in the dataset

# Step 2: Data Encoding
Define a function to encode the purchase methods

# Step 3: Applying the Encoding Function
Apply the encoding function to the Method column

# Step 4: K-means Clustering
Initialize and train K-means models with 2 and 3 clusters

# Step 5: Adding Clusters to DataFrame
Add the cluster assignments to the DataFrame

# Step 6: Visualizing Clusters
Create scatter plots to visualize the clusters

# Step 7: Analyzing Results
Analyze the clustering results to determine the differences between the two models

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to perform customer segmentation using K-means clustering. By analyzing different clustering models, we can gain insights into customer behaviors and tailor our marketing strategies accordingly.
